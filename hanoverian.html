    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The Hanoverian horse is arguably the most successful and well known of all the German warmbloods perhaps even of all the European warmblood breeds.  It is an iconic sports horse noted for its fine conformation, athletic ability and performance record; as a modern athlete to compete in either dressage or show jumping, you could not want for more.


The Hanoverian is more modern than some of the European breeds perhaps because its specific creation was to provide a lighter working horse than the then available draught animals. The breed was created in 1735 in Celle by George II, King of England and Elector of Hanover. Crosses of Spanish and Neapolitan horses were used followed by the Thoroughbred. This then produced a lighter horse which could function on the battlefield, but also be put into harness and was still strong enough to work on the farm. The official studbook was started in 1888.
