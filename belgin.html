    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Belgium is the country of origin of this breed. The breeding of this horse dates from the early 17th century. The studbook organization was founded in 1886, since then the quality of the horses and the breeding in general strongly improved. The Belgian Draft Horse enjoyed quickly a worldwide reputation with as result a strong growth in export to among others America, Germany, Italy, Russia, France,... .

Shortly after the end of World War II motive power started a inexorable battle against horsepower. The number of drafts declined spectacularly.

Today it is the love and passion of the breeders which keeps the Draft Horse alive but the ever decreasing number of foals is a threat for inbreeding and even extinction. The Studbook organisation does a lot of effort to preserve this beautiful breed.
