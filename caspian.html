    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
The Caspian horse holds the distinction of being both one of the oldest and one of the newest of horse breeds. Current archeozoologic evidence dates the Caspian back to at least 3,000 BC, pre-dating other recognized breeds of horses. When the Persian Empire collapsed in 644 AD, its royal horse was “lost” for more than a thousand years until its re-discovery in 1965. The Caspian may represent Horse Type 4 in the development of the modern horse, making it the only foundation type that exists as a modern breed. During its 5,000 year saga, the Caspian has experienced life as a royal treasure and a peasant’s cart horse. It has served as a source of national pride and a source of meat. While research on the breed’s origins continues, the current story of the Caspian horse is nothing short of amazing.
