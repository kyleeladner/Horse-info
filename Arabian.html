    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Arabian horses have distinctive characteristics, that distinguish them from the other horse breeds. First and foremost - they are an ancient breed, with registries and enthusiasts around the world and are the primary cross in the development of other important horse breeds of the world; considered a “hot blooded” breed, as the Thoroughbred horse is also. In fact, every registered Thoroughbred can trace its ancestry back to three Arabian stallions: The Darley Arabian, the Byerley Turk and the Godolphin Arabian, all of which were imported into Great Britain to cross with native mares, producing faster offspring for racing. Secondly, ranging in size from 14.2 to 15.2 hands tall (with occasional larger or smaller sizes) they are fine boned, with a dished face, wide set eyes, long neck, sloping shoulder, short back, flat croup, and high set tail - all of which characteristics are considered to be beautiful by admirers this breed. Thirdly, they have a spirited, inquisitive nature that makes them highly intelligent, which is sometimes a detriment as people confuse this intelligence with disobedience or unruliness when in fact it is just their nature. To own and get along well with an Arabain horse, you must realize and understand that this breed thinks more than other breeds making it much more reactive in certain circumstances. They are almost every color with gray, chestnut and bay being most common. Black is highly prized among some breeders but it is only with an out-cross that you would have a pinto, palomino or other strictly color breed. Some interesting facts are that one of the oldest bands of Arabian horses is owned by Al Marah Arabians, now located in Florida. In 1956, Al-Marah Arabians added the horses from Crabbet Stud and Hanstead Stud to their herd and has been the principle breeder of the Arabian Horses first gathered from the desert by Abbas Pasha in 1815, making Al-Marah the oldest privately owned band of Arabian Horses in the world. The Black Stallion, by Walter Farley is one of the most popular horse stories of all time. Walter was still in high school when his love of horses prompted him to begin writing The Black Stallion and only 26 when it was published by Random House. The story is about a black Arabian stallion and young boy shipwrecked at sea and lost on a deserted island. The movie is very cool, too.
